## KenaxOS

A hobby operating system I developed in middle school as a way to understand how operating systems work, and to get my feet wet in OS development, assembly code, and C.

I thought I transfer this old repository from sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/kenaxos/) to github and possibly continue development during my "free" time.  This operating system is not meant to be practicle but merely a hobby project to play around and experiment with design implementations.
